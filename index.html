If you’re thirsty and have always wanted to know about looking for space microbes on Europa, what medieval people really thought about dragons, how to make energy from alternative sources, or what a philosopher has to say about what the heck is actually going on, come to Public Works! It’s a free event in the style of Nerd Night but designed just for Ithaca. We’re bringing a variety of intellectually-stimulating presentations right to you for your entertainment and educational pleasure at <a href = 'http://thedownstairsithaca.com/'>The Downstairs</a>, the bar below The Watershed. Come hear talks given by Cornell and IC graduate students, professors, community experts, and everything in between! Each session will feature one to three accessible talks, followed by a Q&A session where audience participation is highly encouraged but not required!
<br>
<br>


Bring a friend, make a friend, ask an expert, and drink a beer!

The October 5th Public Works event featured two talk flavors in one night:
<br>
<br>


    A <i>humanities</i> talk:
    <br>
    <br>


    <h3>"Did We Believe in Dragons?: Fantastic Animals and the Medieval North Atlantic"</h3>

    by Dr. Seth Koproski, a lecturer at Cornell:
    <br>
    <br>


    Stories of phoenixes, werewolves, unicorns, and dragons fill our media, our libraries, and our minds-- yet, for some reason, we tend to think of medieval people as 'silly' or 'superstitious' for engaging with these same mythic animals. We understand that these creatures are not and were never 'real', but they have served the needs of human writers and storytelling for millennia, including today. This talk is about taking these animals, and medieval belief in general, seriously, asking: Why do these beliefs exist and how were these beliefs practiced? In what books and in what places can we find fantastic animals? And what can the (non)existence of the dragon tell us about how medieval people constructed the world around them?

    <br>
    <br>

    And a <i>science</i> talk:


    <h3>"A Song of Ice and Dust, or: Why We're Sending a 40 Million Dollar Flying Trash Can to Europa" (See the <a href='A Song of Ice and Dust.png'>pretty poster!</a>)</h3>

    by Dr. Zach Ulibarri, a postdoc at Cornell:

    <br>
    <br>
    If you wanted to search for aliens in our very own solar system, where would you look?
    <br>

    What types of signals or measurements could convince you that life is actually there?
    <br>

    Why is the University of Colorado building a $40 million flying trash can and sending it to Europa?
    <br>

    How can a flying trash can find signs of habitability or even potentially alien life?
    <br>

    What in the world does any of that have to do with dust?
    <br>
