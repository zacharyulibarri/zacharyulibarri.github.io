   <h1 id = 'biketrip'>Biking Across America</h1>
   <p>In the summer of 2014 I rode my bicycle, a Trek Marlin 29er, across the continent of North America. I stuck to the Transamerica route from Virginia to Oregon, crossing 10 states in 9 weeks. However, I took a slow, sauntering ride up the coast of Oregon, feasting on seafood, pizza, and craft beer so that my total trip time was ten weeks.</p>
   <p>Below is a photo I took on my second to last day at Canon Beach, OR. You can see from the odometer on the handlebars that at that point I had ridden 4634.5 miles. As a solo biker, I had expected the trip to be a solitary experience, but in turned out to be a highly social one with an interesting cast of characters from all over the world. My trip diary, styled as a blog, can be found below.</a></p>

   <p>Considering that Ithaca is a small town that has an Ivy League university and a liberal arts college, I was surprised to learn that there was no "Nerd Night" equivalent. I greatly enjoyed such events in Colorado and Arizona, where people would gather at a local bar to listen to public lectures on a variety of intellectually-stimulating topics, and felt Ithaca would too. So, I made one myself.</p>

   <p>I am the founder and the lead organizer of <a href = 'www.publicworks.info'>Public Works, An Ithaca Nerd Night Experience</a>. I made friends with the owner of one of my favorite local watering holes and got her on board with the idea, where we'd have talks from Cornell and Ithaca College postdocs, professors, grad students, and community experts on all manner of topics, typically with one science talk and one humanities talk each night. I recruited a lecturer in the Medieval Studies Department to manage the humanities-side speaker selection and advertisements, while I handled the science-side. I made the logos and website, and I gave one of the two talks on the first night, titled "A Song of Ice and Dust, or: Why We're Sending a 40 Million Dollar Flying Trash Can to Europa".</p>

   <p>The first night was a smashing success, with some of my acquaintances later telling me that they turned away at the door because the bar was packed. We had hung posters, which I had <a href = 'images/A Song of Ice and Dust.png'>designed myself</a>, in various departments across campus, blasted emails out to yet more departments, and spread the word through our personal networks. We have since recruited a social media coordinator as an additional team member, and Public Works now meets once a month. It's been standing room only every time.</p>
