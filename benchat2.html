        <p>Ithacans will have the opportunity to attend two different concerts this weekend while supporting local non-profits Ithaca Underground and the Ithaca branch of Planned Parenthood.</p>
    
        <p>On <b>Saturday the 24th</b>, the Ithaca Community School of Music and Arts (CMSA) will host an all-ages two-room fundraiser with local punk and rock outfits on one stage and DJs and techno artists on a second stage. The benefits will support Ithaca Underground, a non-profit started in 2007 that seeks to "provide the people of Ithaca and the surrounding communities with an all ages, radically inclusive environment for their do-it-yourself ambitions, ensuring that new and challenging music and art is available to all."</p>
        
        <p>Sets at the CSMA will be staggered between a downstairs and an upstairs stage so that attendees can see each band in sequence. The upstairs stage at the CSMA will feature indie-noise rock band <a href = 'https://nightoftheiguana.bandcamp.com/album/night-of-the-iguana'>Night of the Iguana</a>, a fusion of Gamelan and indie rock by Cornell band <a href = 'https://twincourt.bandcamp.com/album/live-from-b20'>Twin Court</a>, and rock and math rock from the explosive Ithaca College bands <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/banditthisbanditthat/'>Small Bandit</a> and <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/bigbobodoll/'>Bobo Doll</a>.</p>

        </div>  
            
        <p>The downstairs stage will feature techno artists <a href = 'https://soundcloud.com/xhadowcat'>DJ Xhadow Cat</a>, <a href = 'https://soundcloud.com/kimberlyaparece'>Kimberly Aparece</a>, <a href = 'https://djhighstone.com/'>DJ Highstone</a>, and a set by <a href = 'https://glitterskulls.bandcamp.com/'>Glitter Skulls</a> with  <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/nube_nunca/'>nube_nunca</a>. Local filmmaker and dark ambient artist Chris Knight, who will be performing as Glitter Skulls, is organizing the fundraiser. He first came to an Ithaca Underground show in 2007 as an Ithaca College student, "looking for an alternative music community.  I soon found myself playing my own shows, and became part of the team running sound for events, booking shows, and eventually joining the Board... It's been really rewarding to create formative experiences for young and early career artists, and to see the sense of wonder from audiences after they witness a mind blowing performance."</p>

        Ithaca College senior Wallace Petruziello, the frontman of Small Bandit who will also be making a guest appearance with Twin Court, says that Ithaca Underground paved the way for "a currently ongoing golden age of live music in Ithaca" by contributing two very important things to the Ithaca scene. Firstly, "the idea that any interpretation of what music can be, no matter how radical, has a place and an audience here," and secondly, "a space for anyone to gather, no matter how social or antisocial they want to be that night."

        <p>Ithaca Underground is a 100% volunteer-run organization, and 90% of proceeds from a typical show will go to the performing artists. "However," Knight says, "we still have to pay for professional services and day to day expenses to keep our status as a 501(c)(3), sound system equipment, and other costs. It's been a long time tradition of Ithaca Underground to host a unique event for a February fundraiser" to keep the program running. Or perhaps as DJ Highstone wrote on Instagram, "This annual fundraiser helps to make these events possible, keeps the quality high, and the sound loud." Tickets for the benefit are available for $10 at Angry Mom Records on the Commons or online <a href = 'https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/7a111e7a-bee2-492a-8707-30ae37865e64'>here</a>. Prices will gradually rise to $20 on the day of the show, which starts at 6 PM.</p>

        </div>  

        <p>On <b>Sunday the 25th</b> from 4-11 PM, the Argos Warehouse will host a pop-in pop-out benefit for the Ithaca Planned Parenthood featuring no less than eight local country and Americana bands. Janet Batch, who will be performing as part of <a href = 'http://www.janetbatch.com/'>Janet Batch and the Four Bangers</a>, described the event as a "a real who's who of Ithaca Country music." She says, "I love the country vibe and can't wait to hear what everyone brings out!"</p>
    
       <p>Event organizer Dustin Stuhr, who will be performing with the outlaw country band <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/chickenwireparachute/'>Chickenwire Parachute</a>, has worked on a number of benefits for non-profits featuring local musicians over the years, but he says he "became drawn to Planned Parenthood specifically after the overturning of <i>Roe V. Wade</i>.  I believe women's health is an important community issue and I feel that religious dogma has no place interfering with that." For her part, Batch says, " I love Planned Parenthood and have been a supporter since college. They provide a welcoming, judgement-free, educational approach to all manners of health and reproductive care. I especially love their mission to provide quality services for underserved individuals and communities.</p>

       <p>In addition to Batch and Stuhr's bands, the benefit will feature performances by <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/drewkiddooandtheblackouts/'>Drew Kiddoo and the Blackouts</a>, <a href = 'https://dartbrothers.com/'>The Dart Brothers</a>, Mortal Combine, <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/rev_ezra/'>Rev Ezra</a>, <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/gooddog_band/'>Good Dog</a>, and <a href = 'https://www.freightmusic.com/'>Freight</a>.</p>
      
    <p>"The thing is," Stuhr says, "Ithaca has a burgeoning country/Americana music scene. There are so many bands that play in the neighborhood of country music, and I feel that needs to be recognized and celebrated... This is a marriage of celebrating Ithaca's Americana music scene and raising money for a cause that impacts  virtually everyone in the community."</p>
        
    <p>There is a suggested donation of $20 for the event, and the Argos Warehouse will offer drinks at half off for attendees. Ticketholders will be able to come and go as the show goes on. But whether you're there for the whole time or just part of the time, be sure, Batch says, to "bring your dancing shoes!"</p>
